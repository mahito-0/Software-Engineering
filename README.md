🛠️ ShobKaaj – Local Job & Service Finder App
ShobKaaj is a mobile application designed to connect clients with trusted local workers for a wide range of services — from household repairs and tutoring to delivery, freelance help, and errands. This platform aims to bridge the employment gap in Bangladesh by offering a verified, location-based, and inclusive digital job marketplace for both urban and rural communities.

🌍 Problem Background
In Bangladesh, many skilled individuals — such as students, freelancers, and laborers — struggle to find consistent work or reliable clients.
