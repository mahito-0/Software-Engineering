Here’s a practical **Sprint plan** for your **ShobKaaj project**, based on the Scrum backlog you approved. I’ve broken it down into **5 focused sprints**, assuming 1–2 weeks per sprint (typical for Scrum), and organized them in a logical build-first-then-polish order.

Each sprint targets a **release-ready mini-version** of the app that delivers usable features.
